L20n provides a way to define reusable pieces of logic through user-defined macros.

Macros take arguments (which are referenced in the macro's body with the dollar syntax: `$arg`) and return strings.  The logic is described through simple if-else statements (using the ternary operator: `a ? b : c`).  You call macros with arguments using the C-like syntax: `macro(arg1, arg2)`.

You can call macros everywhere where you can put entities:  inside of string values: `{% raw %}{{ macro(arg) }}{% endraw %}`, in indexes and even in other macros.  You can't, however, pass references to macros like  you do with entities; for instance, you can't pass a macro (without calling it) as an argument to another macro.  Lastly, macros can only return primitive values, i.e. strings, numbers and booleans.

In the example below, we define a macro called `plural` which takes one argument, `$n`.  In the macro's body, `$n` is compared with 0 and 1, and based on its value, one of `zero`, `one` and `many` is returned.  The returned string is then used as the index of the `shared` entity.  Notice that we're defining a two-value index:  first we choose the plural variant, then we look at the gender and choose the final translation based on that.
